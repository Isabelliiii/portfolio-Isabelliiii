All 7xx incidents represent False Alarm & False Call responses (e.g., alarm system malfunctions, detector errors, accidental activations, and malicious alarms) and were coded as 1. Incidents in the 1xx and 2xx series correspond to actual fires and overpressure/explosion events that required genuine emergency response; these were coded as 0.

Prior research shows that alarm activity often correlates with community demographics, housing conditions, and economic stressors. Accordingly, we included measures of population composition, educational attainment, income, and labor force status to capture these broader social determinants.\n\n\nCode\nphilly_census &lt;- get_acs(\ngeography = \"tract\",\nvariables = c(\ntotal_pop = \"B01003_001\",\nblack = \"B02001_003\",\nba_degree = \"B15003_022\",\ntotal_edu = \"B15003_001\",\nmedian_income = \"B19013_001\",\nlabor_force = \"B23025_003\",\nunemployed = \"B23025_005\"\n),\nyear = 2023,\nstate = \"PA\",\ncounty = \"Philadelphia\",\ngeometry = TRUE\n) |&gt;\ndplyr::select(GEOID, variable, estimate, geometry) |&gt;\ntidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = estimate) |&gt;\ndplyr::mutate(\nba_rate = 100 * ba_degree / total_edu,\nunemployment_rate = 100 * unemployed / labor_force,\nblack_share = 100 * black / total_pop\n) |&gt;\nst_transform(st_crs(fire))\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Fire Alarm Data\nBuilding certification information comes from the City of Philadelphia’s Licenses and Inspections (L&I) Building Certifications dataset on OpenDataPhilly. We joined these records to the building footprints to identify each building’s fire-alarm certification status (Active, Expired, or Deficient). Including this information allows the model to account for building-level inspection and maintenance conditions, which are closely related to false-alarm occurrences.\n\n\nCode\nbldg_foot &lt;- st_read(\"data/LI_BUILDING_FOOTPRINTS.shp\", quiet = TRUE)\ncert_sum &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/BUILDING_CERT_SUMMARY.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nbldg_cert &lt;- bldg_foot |&gt;\n  mutate(bin = as.character(bin)) |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    cert_sum |&gt;\n      mutate(structure_id = as.character(structure_id)),\n    by = c(\"bin\" = \"structure_id\")\n  )\n\nbldg_cert |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  summarise(n_bldg = n_distinct(bin))\n\n\n  n_bldg\n1  26310\n\n\nCode\nbldg_cert |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  count(fire_alarm_status, sort = TRUE)\n\n\n  fire_alarm_status     n\n1            Active 13241\n2           Expired  7635\n3              &lt;NA&gt;  5098\n4         Deficient   340\n\n\nWe spatially joined the building certification records to census tracts to summarize inspection conditions at the neighborhood level. For each tract, we calculated the number of buildings with Active, Expired, or Deficient fire-alarm certifications and derived an active certification rate.

Including weather information allows the model to capture environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed that may influence alarm activations and false-alarm likelihood.\n\n\nCode\nget_phl &lt;- function(start, end) \n  riem_measures(\n    station     = \"PHL\",\n    date_start  = start,\n    date_end    = end,\n    report_type = c(\"routine\", \"specials\", \"hfmetar\")\n  )\n\nw1 &lt;- get_phl(\"2024-01-01\", \"2024-03-31\")\nw2 &lt;- get_phl(\"2024-04-01\", \"2024-06-30\")\nw3 &lt;- get_phl(\"2024-07-01\", \"2024-09-30\")\nw4 &lt;- get_phl(\"2024-10-01\", \"2024-12-31\")\nw5 &lt;- get_phl(\"2025-01-01\", \"2025-06-30\")\nw6 &lt;- get_phl(\"2025-07-01\", \"2025-10-06\")\n\nweather_data &lt;- bind_rows(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6) |&gt;\n  arrange(valid) |&gt;\n  distinct(valid, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\nrange(weather_data$valid)\n\n\n[1] \"2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\" \"2025-10-05 23:55:00 UTC\"\n\n\nCode\nnrow(weather_data)\n\n\n[1] 196666\n\n\n\n\nCode\nweather_processed &lt;- weather_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    interval60    = floor_date(valid, unit = \"hour\"),\n    Temperature   = tmpf,\n    Precipitation = ifelse(is.na(p01i), 0, p01i),\n    Wind_Speed    = sknt\n  ) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(interval60, Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::distinct()\n\nweather_complete &lt;- weather_processed %&gt;%\n  tidyr::complete(\n    interval60 = seq(min(interval60), max(interval60), by = \"hour\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::fill(Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(lubridate::hour(interval60) == 12) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::arrange(interval60) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(interval60)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::slice(1) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::ungroup() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(date, Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed)\n\nweather_complete$Precipitation &lt;- weather_complete$Precipitation + 0.00001\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Work Days and Weekends\nFrom the cleaned weather dataset, we generated a day-of-week variable and an is_weekend flag to capture weekly temporal patterns in alarm activity. Weekend versus weekday distinctions are included because building use and human activity differ substantially across the week. On weekends, many commercial and institutional buildings operate at reduced occupancy, while residential buildings experience increased activity. These shifts can influence how alarm systems behave through factors such as maintenance schedules, system testing times, building vacancy, cooking activity, or nuisance triggers.\n\n\nCode\nweather_daily &lt;- weather_complete %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    dow        = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1),\n    is_weekend = as.integer(dow %in% c(\"Sat\", \"Sun\"))   # 0 = weekday, 1 = weekend\n  )\n\nweather_daily %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(is_weekend)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  is_weekend     n\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1          0   460\n2          1   184\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Location of Fire Stations\nWe incorporated the locations of Philadelphia fire stations by converting the Fire_Dept table into a spatial dataset using station latitude and longitude. A 100-meter buffer was generated around each station to capture buildings located very close to fire infrastructure. Proximity to a fire station may relate to false-alarm activity, for example, areas near stations may include larger commercial buildings with more alarm systems, more frequent maintenance activity, or higher reporting sensitivity."

Higher-expiry areas (shaded in darker purple) appear in several parts of North and West Philadelphia, as well as pockets of the Northeast. These neighborhoods tend to show a larger proportion of buildings whose annual alarm inspections are overdue, signaling potential maintenance challenges or compliance gaps. In contrast, many tracts in Center City and portions of South Philadelphia display lower expired shares, suggesting stronger inspection adherence. The geographic pattern indicates that certification compliance is not uniform across the city and may align with broader socioeconomic differences, telling us areas where targeted outreach or enforcement may be most needed."

The model’s coefficients suggest that areas with higher educational attainment and larger Black population shares exhibit higher probabilities of false alarms, even after controlling for weather and building-level compliance activity. Compared with the baseline model, the residual deviance decreases from 67133 to 59730 and the AIC drops from 67143 to 59748, indicating a markedly better fit.

Adding socioeconomic factors, temporal indicators, and spatial proximity variables substantially improves model fit, reducing deviance and lowering AIC compared to Models 1 and 2. Several predictors show significant associations with false-alarm likelihood, most notably education level, racial composition, unemployment rate, and building certification activity while weather variables retain moderate predictive power. Temporal effects are modest but present, with higher false-alarm rates in Q3 and lower rates in Q4. Spatial features contribute additional explanatory value, as calls nearer to fire stations and farther from Center City are slightly less likely to be false alarms. Overall, the full model captures the most complete set of behavioral, environmental, and geographic signals and therefore serves as the best-performing specification for subsequent interpretation and policy analysis."

Model 1 achieves an AUC of 0.554, indicating very limited predictive power and only marginal improvement over random guessing. Adding socioeconomic variables in Model 2 substantially increases the AUC to 0.670, suggesting that neighborhood‐level demographic and income patterns provide meaningful signal in distinguishing false alarms from true fire events. The full model (Model 3), which incorporates temporal indicators, proximity to fire stations, and distance to downtown, yields the highest AUC of 0.672. Although the improvement over Model 2 is modest, it indicates that these operational and spatial predictors add incremental information beyond weather and socioeconomic structure.\n\n\n4.4.2 ROC Curve\n\n\nCode\nplot(roc1, col = \"blue\", lwd = 2, main = \"ROC Curves for Logit Models\")\nplot(roc2, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)\nplot(roc3, col = \"purple\", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)\nlegend(\"bottomright\",\n       legend = c(\"Model 1\", \"Model 2\", \"Model 3\"),\n       col    = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"purple\"),\n       lwd    = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ROC curves visualize how each model balances sensitivity and specificity across all possible thresholds. Model 1 shows the weakest discrimination, with a curve only slightly above the 45-degree no-skill line. Model 2 improves substantially once socioeconomic characteristics are added, producing a visibly steeper curve. Model 3 offers a modest gain: adding temporal factors and spatial proximity variables produces the strongest curve overall, indicating the most consistent ability to distinguish false alarms from real incidents across thresholds.\n\n\n4.4.3 K-fold Cross Validation\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123)\n\nfire_cv &lt;- fire_firetract |&gt;\n  sf::st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    y = ifelse(inc_new == 1, \"FalseAlarm\", \"RealIncident\"),\n    y = factor(y, levels = c(\"FalseAlarm\", \"RealIncident\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(\n    y,\n    Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed, active_rate,\n    median_income, ba_rate, black_share, unemployment_rate,\n    is_weekend, quarter, near_station_200m, dist_cityhall_km\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::drop_na()\n\ntrain_control &lt;- trainControl(\n  method = \"cv\",\n  number = 5,\n  classProbs = TRUE,\n  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary\n)\n\nlogit_cv_model &lt;- train(\n  y ~ .,\n  data      = fire_cv,\n  method    = \"glm\",\n  family    = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\n  trControl = train_control,\n  metric    = \"ROC\"\n)\n\nlogit_cv_model\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Model \n\n59340 samples\n   12 predictor\n    2 classes: 'FalseAlarm', 'RealIncident' \n\nNo pre-processing\nResampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) \nSummary of sample sizes: 47472, 47473, 47471, 47472, 47472 \nResampling results:\n\n  ROC       Sens       Spec      \n  0.671565  0.9858302  0.06613265\n\n\nTo assess the stability of the full logistic regression model, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the training data. The cross-validated ROC (0.672) is nearly identical to the in-sample ROC reported earlier, indicating that the model’s predictive performance is highly stable across different data splits. The very high sensitivity and low specificity largely reflect the substantial class imbalance in the outcome (false alarms ≈ 77%). Because classification thresholds are not yet optimized at this stage, these values are not used for model selection; instead, cross-validation primarily confirms that the model generalizes consistently.\n\n\n4.4.4 Odds Ratios for Model 3\n\n\nCode\nor_table_simple &lt;- tidy(logit_model3) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    odds_ratio = round(exp(estimate), 3)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(\n    Variable = term,\n    Odds_Ratio = odds_ratio\n  )\n\nkable(\n  or_table_simple,\n  caption = \"Odds Ratios for Logit Model 3\",\n  align = \"lr\"\n)\n\n\n\nOdds Ratios for Logit Model 3\n\n\nVariable\nOdds_Ratio\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.292\n\n\nTemperature\n1.007\n\n\nPrecipitation\n37483869.597\n\n\nWind_Speed\n1.004\n\n\nactive_rate\n1.596\n\n\nmedian_income\n1.000\n\n\nba_rate\n1.056\n\n\nblack_share\n1.014\n\n\nunemployment_rate\n1.014\n\n\nis_weekend\n0.937\n\n\nquarterQ2\n0.970\n\n\nquarterQ3\n1.087\n\n\nquarterQ4\n0.843\n\n\nnear_station_200m\n0.899\n\n\ndist_cityhall_km\n0.996\n\n\n\n\n\nThe odds‐ratio table summarizes how each predictor influences the likelihood that an incident is classified as a false alarm after controlling for all other variables. Weather variables, particularly temperature and precipitation, remain strong predictors, with higher temperatures and any measurable precipitation increasing the likelihood of a false alarm. Building compliance also matters: tracts with higher active certification rates show significantly greater odds of false alarms, consistent with patterns observed in the earlier models. Socioeconomic context continues to contribute meaningful signal, higher educational attainment, a larger Black population share, and higher unemployment are all associated with elevated false-alarm odds, even after controlling for weather and temporal factors. Temporal features add smaller but still interpretable effects: false alarms are slightly less likely on weekends and in Q4, and marginally more likely in Q3. Finally, spatial accessibility plays a role: incidents occurring near a fire station (&lt;200m) or farther from Center City show modestly reduced odds of being false alarms. Together, these results suggest that false-alarm activity reflects an interaction of environmental conditions, neighborhood characteristics, and system operations."

This setting is appropriate in contexts where misclassifying a real emergency as a false alarm is unacceptable, such as prioritizing safety or enforcement on only the most extreme cases.\nThreshold = 0.4 (Aggressive) A threshold of 0.4 classifies an incident as a false alarm when the predicted probability exceeds 40%.\nExtremely high sensitivity (99.95%): nearly all false alarms are detected (only 23 missed).\nVery low specificity (0.28%): almost all true incidents are incorrectly labeled as false alarms.\nThis threshold identifies almost every false alarm but also generates a large number of false positives. This setting is useful in contexts where the goal is to maximize detection, such as broad preventive inspections or outreach."

    "text": "6.1 Limitations\nAlthough the model provides meaningful predictive ability, it still faces several important limitations. First, the data contain gaps and inconsistencies, for example, missing or outdated fire-alarm certificate records and uneven data quality across neighborhoods which can reduce model stability. Second, because the current model is binary, it can only classify alarms as “false” vs. “not false,” and cannot distinguish different levels of fire risk. No matter how high or low the predicted probability is, the final decision still requires using a single threshold, which restricts how much nuance the model can express. In addition, any misclassification carries real consequences: mislabeling a true fire as a false alarm could delay response, while treating a likely false alarm as high risk may burden residents and property owners and potentially exacerbate existing enforcement inequities. For these reasons, the model should be used as a decision-support tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment."

    "text": "6.2 Improvement Possibilities\nWith richer data, more development time, or additional funding, the model could be expanded into a multi-tier risk classification system, instead of a simple binary prediction. For example, alarms could be grouped into four levels:\n\nTier 1 = high emergency (very likely real fire)\nTier 2 = moderate risk (standard response)\nTier 3 = minor risk (non-emergency conditions possible)\nTier 4 = high-probability false alarm (light response package)\n\nAchieving this would require integrating additional features, such as alarm device age, building maintenance histories, humidity/smoke environment data, renovation activity, and more granular spatial patterns. These richer inputs would allow the model to shift from hard thresholding to continuous risk scoring and tiered operational strategies, enabling more precise allocation of fire-department resources. Future enhancements could also include multiclass models or time-series analysis to support an even more nuanced and safety-balanced dispatch framework."

Sales were limited to 2023–2024 to focus on the most recent housing market conditions.A subset of relevant columns—such as property characteristics, sale price, and geographic information—was retained to reduce processing time and support exploratory analysis.\nRemoving obvious errors and handling missing values\nExtremely low sale prices—often suspected to be due to inheritance transfers—were excluded to avoid biasing the model. Properties with a reported construction year of “0” were also removed, as these are unrealistic. Similarly, properties with nonpositive living area were excluded, since living area must be greater than zero.\nTransforming to spatial format and calculating additional attributes\nThe cleaned dataset was then converted to an sf (spatial features) object to enable spatial analysis. An additional variable, house age, was calculated based on the difference between the sale year and the year built, allowing for further filtering of unrealistic building ages and facilitating later modeling steps.\nIntegrating census and spatial amenity data\nCensus tract–level socioeconomic data were obtained via the tidycensus package and spatially joined to the property dataset using st_within(). This ensured that only properties located within the official boundaries of Philadelphia were retained. Additional contextual datasets from OpenDataPhilly (e.g., parks, schools, and public facilities)—were also prepared in phase 3 for subsequent analysis to examine how neighborhood characteristics may influence property prices.\nFinal dataset summary\nThrough this cleaning and integration process, the dataset was reduced from 583,776 initial records to 42,383 after initial filtering, and then to 25,860 after further refinement. Following the spatial join with census tract data, the final analytical dataset contained 25,585 valid property records with complete socioeconomic and spatial information."

Sales were limited to 2023–2024 to focus on the most recent housing market conditions.A subset of relevant columns—such as property characteristics, sale price, and geographic information—was retained to reduce processing time and support exploratory analysis.\nRemoving obvious errors and handling missing values\nExtremely low sale prices—often suspected to be due to inheritance transfers—were excluded to avoid biasing the model. Properties with a reported construction year of “0” were also removed, as these are unrealistic. Similarly, properties with nonpositive living area were excluded, since living area must be greater than zero.\nTransforming to spatial format and calculating additional attributes\nThe cleaned dataset was then converted to an sf (spatial features) object to enable spatial analysis. An additional variable, house age, was calculated based on the difference between the sale year and the year built, allowing for further filtering of unrealistic building ages and facilitating later modeling steps.\nIntegrating census and spatial amenity data\nCensus tract–level socioeconomic data were obtained via the tidycensus package and spatially joined to the property dataset using st_within(). This ensured that only properties located within the official boundaries of Philadelphia were retained. Additional contextual datasets from OpenDataPhilly (e.g., parks, schools, and public facilities)—were also prepared in phase 3 for subsequent analysis to examine how neighborhood characteristics may influence property prices.\nFinal dataset summary\nThrough this cleaning and integration process, the dataset was reduced from 583,776 initial records to 42,383 after initial filtering, and then to 25,860 after further refinement. Following the spatial join with census tract data, the final analytical dataset contained 25,585 valid property records with complete socioeconomic and spatial information."

Despite using 50 bins, the distribution remains highly right-skewed, with the vast majority of transactions concentrated below roughly $1.5 million and a small number of luxury properties extending far beyond that range. To address this heavy right tail, we trimmed observations above the 98th percentile of sale prices. This cutoff removes extreme luxury transactions that disproportionately influence the scale, while still preserving over 98% of the housing market.\nThe second histogram presents this trimmed distribution, excluding the top 2% of sales. After removing these extreme outliers, the shape becomes much clearer and more interpretable—revealing a unimodal, approximately log-normal pattern centered around the city’s median sale price.\n\n\n2.

However, there is also substantial variation among properties of similar size, reflecting the influence of location, building condition, and neighborhood characteristics.\nOverall, this visualization confirms that livable area is positively associated with sale price, though it is not the only factor shaping property values across the city.\n\n\n4.

Narrative Explaining Feature Engineering\nDuring the feature engineering phase, a series of spatial indicators were developed to capture neighborhood-level conditions relevant to property values across Philadelphia.\n\nCreating buffer-based accessibility features\nTransit stops within a 400 m radius were counted for each property to represent public transport accessibility, a key component of urban connectivity. Recreation facilities within 1.2 km were used to approximate walkable access to amenities under the “15-minute city” concept, which reflects daily life convenience and potentially higher demand in middle- and high-income areas. A categorical variable of recreations was created to classify accessibility as None, Low, Medium, or High.\nAdding location dummies and urban core identification\nA binary indicator identified whether a property lies within Philadelphia’s Center City boundary. This variable captures the premium effect of the city’s dense commercial and employment core, where housing demand remains consistently high.\nIncorporating nearest-neighbor proximity features\nThe shortest distance to hospitals was calculated using the k-nearest neighbor approach to represent healthcare accessibility."

Older houses are generally less expensive, but the positive squared term for house age suggests that this decline slows over time—very old or historic homes may retain or regain value. Overall, the model explains about 45% of the variation in sale prices, indicating a reasonably strong fit.\n\n\n2.Census variables\nThis model incorporates neighborhood socioeconomic factors drawn from Census data. Variables such as median income, education level (BA rate), unemployment, and racial composition, which introduce the broader census data context into the housing price model.\n\n\nCode\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms +\n               number_of_bathrooms + house_age + I(house_age^2) +\n               median_income + ba_rate + log(unemployment_rate+1) + black_share,\n             data = opa_census)\nsummary(model2)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age + I(house_age^2) + median_income + \n    ba_rate + log(unemployment_rate + 1) + black_share, data = opa_census)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1494787   -67062   -10215    44754  1241464 \n\nCoefficients:\n                             Estimate Std.

Structural effects remain similar: larger area and more bathrooms increase value, while older homes are cheaper but the decline slows with age. Adding neighborhood factors improves accuracy—homes in areas with higher income and education levels sell for more, while higher unemployment and larger Black population shares correspond to lower prices. This shows that both property traits and local socioeconomic context shape housing values.\n\n\n3. Spatial features\nThis step adds spatial variables to capture location effects in prices and to improve prediction. We include crime count as safety, transit stops within 400 m as mobility access, recreation within 1.2 km as amenity access, and hospital distance as service access.\n\n\nCode\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms +\n               number_of_bathrooms + house_age + I(house_age^2) +\n               median_income + ba_rate + log(unemployment_rate+1) + black_share +\n               crime_count + I(crime_count^2) + \n               transit_count + recreation_count + nearest_hospital_m + I(nearest_hospital_m^2),\n             data = opa_census)\nsummary(model3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age + I(house_age^2) + median_income + \n    ba_rate + log(unemployment_rate + 1) + black_share + crime_count + \n    I(crime_count^2) + transit_count + recreation_count + nearest_hospital_m + \n    I(nearest_hospital_m^2), data = opa_census)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1527075   -66187    -9409    45418  1231837 \n\nCoefficients:\n                             Estimate Std.

The explanatory power improves slightly (R² rises from 0.60 to 0.61). Core structural effects remain consistent: larger homes and more bathrooms raise prices, while older homes are cheaper but depreciate more slowly with age.\nAmong the new variables, transit access and recreation facilities show strong positive effects—areas with better public transport and more recreation sites have higher housing values. Proximity to hospitals also matters: prices fall as distance increases, but the positive squared term suggests diminishing marginal effects once the hospital is very close. Crime count is mostly insignificant, implying limited direct influence after controlling for other neighborhood factors.\n\n\n4. Interactions and fixed effects\nThis final model adds interaction and dummy variables to capture more detailed relationships. The interaction term between crime count and unemployment rate examines how the effect of crime varies with local economic conditions. Dummy variables identify categorical differences: has_garage explains the house stucture, center_city_dummy represents the city core premium, and recreation_dummy classifies recreational access levels.\n\n\nCode\nmodel4 &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms +number_of_bathrooms +\n               house_age + I(house_age^2) +\n               median_income + ba_rate + crime_count*unemployment_rate + black_share + \n               has_garage + center_city_dummy + recreation_dummy + \n               transit_count + nearest_hospital_m + I(nearest_hospital_m^2),\n             data = opa_census)\nsummary(model4)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ total_livable_area + number_of_bedrooms + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age + I(house_age^2) + median_income + \n    ba_rate + crime_count * unemployment_rate + black_share + \n    has_garage + center_city_dummy + recreation_dummy + transit_count + \n    nearest_hospital_m + I(nearest_hospital_m^2), data = opa_census)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1483816   -65681   -10090    44396  1232825 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                Estimate Std.

The fit improves slightly again (R² ≈ 0.61). Structural patterns remain stable: larger and newer homes with more bathrooms are worth more, and aging reduces value but at a slowing rate.\nNeighborhood effects also stay consistent—higher income and education raise prices, while higher unemployment and larger Black population shares lower them. In areas with higher unemployment, housing prices are less sensitive to crime; in contrast, in areas with lower unemployment and stronger economic conditions, crime has a larger negative impact on housing values.\nAdding location and amenity dummies refines spatial interpretation. Properties in Center City and those with garages sell for more, while areas with fewer recreation facilities are valued lower. Proximity to hospitals and transit access continue to show positive associations with housing value."

The improvement reflects how adding census, spatial, and interaction terms enhances the model’s ability to capture neighborhood-level variation in housing prices. Residual dispersion decreases, though some bias persists at the extremes: high-value properties tend to be slightly underestimated, while low-value ones are sometimes overpredicted. These patterns are common in real-world housing data, where non-market transactions, inheritances, or atypical sales fall outside the scope of typical market dynamics.\n\n\n3. top 5 predictors visualization\n\n\nCode\nmodel4_std &lt;- lm.beta(model4)\n\ncoef_std &lt;- broom::tidy(model4_std) %&gt;%\n  filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Standardized = model4_std$standardized.coefficients[term])\n\ntop5_std &lt;- coef_std %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(abs(Standardized))) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10)\n\nkable(\n  top5_std %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(term, estimate, Standardized, std.error, statistic, p.value) %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 3))),\n  caption = \"Top 10 Standardized Coefficients from Model 4\"\n)\n\n\n\nTop 10 Standardized Coefficients from Model 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nStandardized\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\ntotal_livable_area\n139.756\n0.353\n1.898\n73.628\n0\n\n\nhouse_age\n-2138.542\n-0.319\n101.520\n-21.065\n0\n\n\nI(house_age^2)\n10.533\n0.236\n0.665\n15.828\n0\n\n\nnearest_hospital_m\n-42.134\n-0.207\n3.313\n-12.717\n0\n\n\nnumber_of_bathrooms\n59752.834\n0.200\n1562.682\n38.237\n0\n\n\nmedian_income\n1.259\n0.195\n0.046\n27.173\n0\n\n\nI(nearest_hospital_m^2)\n0.008\n0.181\n0.001\n11.611\n0\n\n\nba_rate\n2405.764\n0.143\n124.828\n19.273\n0\n\n\nrecreation_dummyLow\n-54254.808\n-0.131\n4947.201\n-10.967\n0\n\n\nrecreation_dummyMedium\n-45676.480\n-0.109\n4897.261\n-9.327\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntop5_std %&gt;%\n  mutate(term = reorder(term, abs(Standardized))) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = Standardized, fill = Standardized &gt; 0)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(Standardized, 3)),\n            hjust = ifelse(top5_std$Standardized &gt; 0, -0.1, 1.1),\n            size = 3.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"skyblue\", \"hotpink\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Standardized Coefficients from Model 4\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Standardized Coefficient (β)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  expand_limits(y = c(-max(abs(top5_std$Standardized)) * 1.2, \n                      max(abs(top5_std$Standardized)) * 1.2)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized coefficients show which variables have the strongest relative influence on housing prices after accounting for differences in measurement units. Total livable area has the largest positive effect, meaning larger homes consistently sell for more. House age shows the strongest negative relationship—older properties tend to be less valuable—but the positive squared term indicates that this decline slows with age. Proximity to hospitals also matters: homes closer to medical facilities are priced higher, while distance reduces value. Among neighborhood and amenity factors, higher education levels (BA rate) and income raise prices, whereas limited recreational access slightly lowers them."

    "text": "Phase 7: Conclusions & Recommendations\nThis project predicts housing sale prices in Philadelphia and shows that structural inequality in the city is spatially organized, with high-value neighborhoods concentrated in the central, northeast, and northwestern parts, and lower-value areas clustered in the north and west.\nThe model shows that actual sale prices in high-value neighborhoods are consistently higher than predicted, while those in lower-income and high-unemployment areas tend to be slightly lower than predicted. This residual pattern indicates a potential bias in the city’s property assessment system, where wealthier neighborhoods may be undertaxed and disadvantaged ones overtaxed.\nIn neighborhoods with high unemployment and crime, the model shows that housing markets no longer respond to safety improvements. Simply adding policing or security programs does not raise property values because the underlying economic conditions remain weak. For safety investments to be effective, policies should focus on rebuilding the local economic base by expanding job opportunities, supporting small businesses, and improving public infrastructure to make these neighborhoods worth to invest.\nThe model primarily captures spatial variation but performs less accurately for properties with sale prices above one million dollars. Some public datasets contain missing or inconsistent records, which may introduce minor systematic bias. Future research should integrate temporal dynamics and machine learning methods to better predict properties at both the lower and upper ends of the sale price distribution.\nTo promote spatial equity, policy should expand affordable and mixed-income housing in high-value districts through inclusionary zoning and other incentives, while improving transit, recreational spaces, and essential urban amenities—such as schools, healthcare facilities, and public services—in underserved neighborhoods, so that opportunity and growth are not confined to a few areas."

I chose graffiti because it is a common and consistently reported 311 issue, it has clear spatial patterns, and it is often used as a proxy for visible disorder in urban areas.\nWhile graffiti has no direct causal link to burglary, it may reflect broader neighborhood conditions such as maintenance levels, social stress, or public activity, which could indirectly relate to crime patterns.

Graffiti Removal calls are concentrated in a few very specific pockets, mainly in the Northwest and parts of the West and Southwest sides. Burglary, however, is more broadly distributed, with multiple hotspots across the West Side, South Side, and the central areas of the city.\nThere is some general overlap in higher-activity regions, but the intensity and location of clusters differ enough that graffiti does not appear to be a consistent indicator of burglary risk. Graffiti reflects surface-level disorder in public space, while burglary involves private property intrusion, which likely responds to different environmental and situational factors."

    "text": "6.4 Key Findings Summary\nOverall, the analysis shows that graffiti-related spatial features provide limited predictive power for burglary counts. Although the Negative Binomial model identifies some statistically significant relationships such as closer proximity to graffiti clusters being associated with slightly higher burglary counts, the effect sizes are small, and the model struggles to capture sharp crime hotspots.\nThe KDE baseline clearly outperforms the regression model in both MAE and RMSE, reinforcing that burglary exhibits strong spatial clustering that is better captured through spatial density patterns than through indirect disorder indicators.\nError maps also show that the model consistently underpredicts major hotspot areas and performs best in low-crime neighborhoods, suggesting that graffiti reflects general urban conditions but does not directly track burglary risk.\nIn short, disorder signals like graffiti may help describe neighborhood environments, but they are not sufficient for accurately predicting burglary patterns on their own. This might because Graffiti Removal 311 calls reflect residents’ reporting behavior more than actual vandalism. High-income neighborhoods tend to overreport, while disadvantaged neighborhoods underreport, producing a spatial pattern that diverges from the true distribution of disorder and therefore has limited predictive value for burglary."

DeSoto, a large suburban county, has a very low MOE(3.2%), meaning its income estimate is highly reliable. Alcorn falls into the moderate range with an MOE of 8.7%, while Adams has much higher MOE(12.5%),indicating lower confidence. This comparison highlights how smaller or more rural counties like Adams may be poorly represented in survey data, which could affect the fairness of algorithmic decisions that rely on these estimates."

    "text": "5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\nYour Task: Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\nExecutive Summary Requirements: 1. Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\n\nOverall Pattern Identification\nOur analysis of Mississippi’s county, and tract-level ACS data reveals systematic differences in data reliability across the state. Larger, more urbanized, and higher-income counties such as DeSoto, Jackson, and Madison consistently show low margins of error (MOE &lt; 5%), making them suitable for algorithmic decision-making. In contrast, smaller, rural, and economically disadvantaged counties—such as Adams, Carroll, Sharkey, and Wilkinson exhibit much higher MOEs, often exceeding 10–20%. These patterns highlight a divide between counties where survey data is robust and those where uncertainty limits the safe use of algorithmic systems.\n\n\nEquity Assessment\nCommunities at the greatest risk of algorithmic bias are those with both high demographic diversity and weaker survey reliability. Rural Black-majority counties such as Adams, or counties with small Hispanic populations, often display elevated MOEs. If algorithms rely on these estimates without adjustment, they risk systematically underrepresenting marginalized groups and misallocating resources away from the very populations most in need of support. By contrast, suburban counties with stable data will receive more consistent outcomes, reinforcing existing inequities between regions.\n\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\nThe root causes of these disparities lie in structural differences in population size, socioeconomic context, and geographic accessibility. Smaller populations with smaller ACS sample sizes, amplifying statistical uncertainty. Rural areas often face higher survey nonresponse rates and logistical barriers that further reduce data precision. At the demographic level, minority populations within smaller tracts tend to have particularly high MOEs, not because their needs are less, but because the survey infrastructure is less effective at capturing their experiences.\n\n\nStrategic Recommendations\nTo address these challenges, the Department should implement a tiered algorithmic framework. For counties with high-confidence data, algorithmic allocation can proceed with minimal oversight. For counties with moderate confidence, algorithms should be deployed but coupled with regular audits and feedback loops to monitor performance. For low-confidence counties, algorithmic reliance should be minimized, with decisions supplemented by local administrative data, targeted surveys, and manual review by policy experts. Beyond the immediate framework, the Department should invest in improving data infrastructure expanding local survey capacity, partnering with community organizations, and ensuring demographic groups with historically unreliable estimates are better represented."

Examples include DeSoto, Harrison, Jackson, Lamar, Lowndes, Madison, Monroe, Rankin, and Warren. These counties generally have larger or more affluent populations, which improves ACS survey precision. Algorithms can be implemented directly in these counties with minimal risk.\n\nCounties requiring additional oversight:\n\nThese are Moderate Confidence counties (MOE 5–10%). Examples include Alcorn (8.7%), Benton (7.8%), Forrest (5.6%), Lee (5.4%), Pike (5.7%) and many others across Mississippi. While the ACS data is usable, there is enough uncertainty that algorithmic decisions could introduce bias or misallocation if left unchecked. Recommendation: Algorithms may be applied here, but outcomes should be monitored carefully. Suggested oversight strategies include:\n\nConducting periodic audits of funding allocations.\nComparing algorithmic outputs with administrative or programmatic data.\nImplementing feedback loops from local service providers to catch anomalies.\n\n\nCounties needing alternative approaches:\n\nThese are Low Confidence counties (MOE &gt; 10%), such as Adams (12.5%), Covington (14.3%), Sharkey (24.9%), Wilkinson (23.6%), Carroll (34.5%) and many others. These counties tend to be smaller, more rural, or economically disadvantaged, which leads to higher survey uncertainty. Relying purely on ACS estimates here risks misidentifying need and exacerbating inequities. Recommendation: Algorithms should not be the sole basis for decision-making in these counties. Alternative approaches include:\n\nSupplementing ACS data with local administrative records (e.g., school enrollment, SNAP participation).\nCommissioning targeted surveys to improve reliability.\nUsing manual review and qualitative input from local stakeholders to guide funding decisions."

This threshold was chosen because the median reflects the central tendency of income distribution and aligns with a relative, within-state definition of economic disadvantage.]\n\nWhat elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\n[We defined elderly-heavy tracts as those with more than 23.5% of residents aged 65 and older, corresponding to the 75th percentile of the elderly population distribution.

The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis\n\nData: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population)\nQuestion: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?”\nOperations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density\nPolicy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\n\nOption B: School Safety Zones\n\nData: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network\nQuestion: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?”\nOperations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage\nPolicy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity\n\nData: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics)\nQuestion: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?”\nOperations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics\nPolicy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment\n\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources\n\nData: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights\nQuestion: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?”\nOperations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis\nPolicy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility\n\nData: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates)\nQuestion: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?”\nOperations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access\nPolicy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health\n\nData: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics)\nQuestion: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?”\nOperations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators\nPolicy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage\n\nData: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings\nQuestion: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?”\nOperations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas\nPolicy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution\n\nData: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods\nQuestion: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?”\nOperations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups\nPolicy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources:\n\nPennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/\nCensus Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns\nTIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics\nIf you have a different idea: Propose your own question! Just make sure:\n\nYou can access the spatial data\nYou can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n# Load your additional dataset\n\nparks &lt;- st_read(\"data/PPR_Program_Sites.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `PPR_Program_Sites' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\dell\\Documents\\GitHub\\portfolio-setup-Isabelliiii\\assignments\\assignment2\\data\\PPR_Program_Sites.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 171 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.2563 ymin: 39.90444 xmax: -74.96944 ymax: 40.12284\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat dataset did you choose and why?\n\n[Dataset chosen: Philadelphia Parks & Recreation Program Sites]\nReason for choice: [This dataset was selected to analyze green space accessibility and recreation equity in Philadelphia. It represents public parks and recreation facilities which is a key indicator of environmental and community well-being. By examining their spatial distribution relative to neighborhood demographics, we can assess whether low-income communities have equitable access to recreational opportunities.]\n\nWhat is the data source and date?\n\n[Data were obtained from OpenDataPhilly – PPR Program Sites, published and maintained by Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. The dataset was accessed and downloaded in October 2025.]\n\nHow many features does it contain?\n\n[- Number of features: 171 program sites - Geometry type: Point - Coordinate Reference System (CRS): WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) - Extent: Longitude -75.2563 to -74.9694, Latitude 39.9044 to 40.1228]\n\nWhat CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n[The dataset was originally in WGS 84 (geographic coordinates), which is not ideal for distance-based analysis. It was reprojected to EPSG:5070 (NAD83 / Conus Albers) for accurate spatial measurement and buffering operations.]\n\n\nparks &lt;- st_transform(parks, 5070)\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\nExamples:\n\n“Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?”\n“Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?”\n“Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\nResearch Question:\nDo low-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia have less access to parks and recreation facilities compared to higher-income areas?\nExplanation:\nThis question investigates whether green space accessibility is distributed equitably across socioeconomic groups in Philadelphia. By analyzing the spatial relationship between parks and recreation sites and census tract median income, this study aims to identify whether environmental and recreational resources are disproportionately concentrated in wealthier neighborhoods which is an important issue for urban equity and public health planning. —\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+):\n\nBuffers\nSpatial joins\nSpatial filtering with predicates\nDistance calculations\nIntersections or unions\nPoint-in-polygon aggregation\n\nYour Task:\n\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n\n# Your spatial analysis\n\nphilly_tracts &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state     = \"PA\",\n  county    = \"Philadelphia\",\n  variables = c(total_pop = \"B01003_001\", medhhinc = \"B19013_001\"),\n  geometry  = TRUE,\n  output    = \"wide\",\n  year      = 2023,    \n  survey    = \"acs5\"\n) %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    GEOID,\n    total_pop = total_popE,\n    medhhinc  = medhhincE,\n    geometry\n  )\n\ntarget_crs &lt;- 5070  \n\nparks_5070  &lt;- st_transform(parks,         target_crs)\ntracts_5070 &lt;- st_transform(philly_tracts, target_crs)\n\nparks_buf &lt;- st_buffer(parks_5070, dist = 800)\ntract_cent &lt;- st_centroid(tracts_5070)\n\ntract_access &lt;- tract_cent %&gt;%\n  mutate(has_park_access = lengths(st_intersects(., parks_buf)) &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  \n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  select(GEOID, has_park_access)\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_access, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nparks_in_tract &lt;- st_join(tracts_5070, parks_5070, join = st_contains) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  count(GEOID, name = \"n_parks\")\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  left_join(parks_in_tract, by = \"GEOID\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(n_parks = ifelse(is.na(n_parks), 0L, n_parks))\n\ncity_median_income &lt;- median(tracts_5070$medhhinc, na.rm = TRUE)\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  mutate(income_group = ifelse(medhhinc &lt; city_median_income, \"Low income\", \"High income\"))\n\naccess_summary &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(income_group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n_tracts     = n(),\n    access_rate  = mean(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_parks   = mean(n_parks, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\naccess_summary\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  income_group n_tracts access_rate mean_parks\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 High income       191       0.717       1.06\n2 Low income        190       0.847       1.07\n3 &lt;NA&gt;               27       0.370       1.15\n\ncitywide &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tracts_with_access    = sum(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tracts_without_access = sum(!has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    access_rate_city      = mean(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\ncitywide\n\n  tracts_with_access tracts_without_access access_rate_city\n1                308                   100         0.754902\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tracts_5070, fill = \"grey92\", color = NA) +\n  geom_sf(data = parks_buf, fill = \"#A7C957\", color = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = tracts_5070 %&gt;% filter(income_group == \"Low income\", !has_park_access),\n    fill = \"#D55E00\", color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.15, alpha = 0.9\n  ) +\n \n  geom_sf(data = parks_5070, color = \"darkgreen\", size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Green Space Equity in Philadelphia\",\n    subtitle = \"Low-income census tracts without a park within 0.5 mile (buffers shown in green)\",\n    caption = \"Sources: OpenDataPhilly (PPR Program Sites), 2019–2023 ACS (tidycensus); distances in EPSG:5070\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey20\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis requirements:\n\nClear code comments explaining each step\nAppropriate CRS transformations\nSummary statistics or counts\nAt least one map showing your findings\nBrief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\n\nYour interpretation:\n[Using a 0.5-mile buffer as a walkable access threshold, low-income tracts exhibit a lower park access rate than high-income tracts, and they also tend to have fewer parks per tract on average. The map highlights clusters of low-income tracts without nearby parks, pointing to potential recreational access gaps. These findings suggest that future park investments and programming should prioritize underserved low-income neighborhoods to improve equitable access to green space and related health benefits.]"

On weekdays, the pattern is dominated by two sharp peaks: a large morning spike around 8–9 AM and an even stronger afternoon peak around 5–6 PM. These align closely with traditional commuting hours, indicating that Indego is heavily used for work-related travel during the week.\nIn contrast, weekend ridership follows a flatter, more gradual curve. Activity starts later in the morning, rises steadily through midday, and maintains moderate levels into the afternoon without a pronounced rush-hour peak.

This means that if a station was busy in the recent past, it is very likely to be busy now as well. Compared to Model 1, the effect of temperature becomes smaller because part of the temporal pattern is now captured by lagged demand. Precipitation becomes more negative and statistically significant, indicating that rainy hours reduce trips even after controlling for recent usage.

All other models also show larger MAE in Q2 (e.g., Model 1 increases from 0.60 to 0.80 trips).\n\nThis suggests that ridership in spring–early summer is somewhat harder to predict than in winter. In Q1, demand is dominated by regular commuter patterns and strong weather effects (cold temperatures and snow suppress many trips), which makes behavior more stable. In Q2, warmer weather allows for more casual and recreational trips, as well as events and irregular travel, so there is more noise that the model cannot fully capture.\nTemporal patterns also differ between Q1 and Q2.\n\nIn Q1, ridership is strongly concentrated in weekday morning and evening peaks, consistent with commuter trips, and weekends are relatively quiet. In Q2, there is more activity during the middle of the day and on weekends, reflecting recreational and leisure use in warmer months. This makes demand less purely “rush-hour driven” and more spread out, which again increases prediction error.\nIn Q2, the most important predictors are still the temporal lag features.\n\nThe coefficients on lag1Hour, lag3Hours, and lag1day are large and highly significant, indicating that recent station-level demand is the strongest signal of current ridership. Time-of-day (hour dummies), day-of-week, and temperature also matter, but their marginal effects become smaller once lags are included. Census variables and station fixed effects add some spatial structure, but they do not reduce MAE and in some cases slightly worsen out-of-sample performance, likely because they are associated with missing data and additional model complexity."

    "text": "The Q2 2025 ridership pattern reflects typical late-spring to early-summer behavior. Overalll daily trip volumes are high compared to winter months, with most days falling between 3,500 and 5,000 trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hourly ridership profile shows a strong distinction between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, the pattern is dominated by two sharp peaks: a large morning spike around 8–9 AM and an even stronger afternoon peak around 5–6 PM. These align closely with traditional commuting hours, indicating that Indego is heavily used for work-related travel during the week.\nIn contrast, weekend ridership follows a flatter, more gradual curve. Activity starts later in the morning, rises steadily through midday, and maintains moderate levels into the afternoon without a pronounced rush-hour peak. This reflects more recreational and discretionary trips rather than structured commuting patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Most popular origin stations\ntop_stations &lt;- indego %&gt;%\n  count(start_station, start_lat, start_lon, name = \"trips\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(trips)) %&gt;%\n  head(20)\n\nkable(top_stations, \n      caption = \"Top 20 Indego Stations by Trip Origins\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n\n\n\nTop 20 Indego Stations by Trip Origins\n\n\nstart_station\nstart_lat\nstart_lon\ntrips\n\n\n\n\n3,010\n39.94711\n-75.16618\n6,278\n\n\n3,032\n39.94527\n-75.17971\n4,751\n\n\n3,359\n39.94888\n-75.16978\n4,181\n\n\n3,028\n39.94061\n-75.14958\n4,028\n\n\n3,163\n39.94974\n-75.18097\n4,000\n\n\n3,020\n39.94855\n-75.19007\n3,946\n\n\n3,185\n39.95169\n-75.15888\n3,914\n\n\n3,066\n39.94561\n-75.17348\n3,899\n\n\n3,022\n39.95472\n-75.18323\n3,856\n\n\n3,054\n39.96250\n-75.17420\n3,767\n\n\n3,161\n39.95486\n-75.18091\n3,629\n\n\n3,362\n39.94816\n-75.16226\n3,552\n\n\n3,063\n39.94633\n-75.16980\n3,516\n\n\n3,213\n39.93887\n-75.16663\n3,332\n\n\n3,059\n39.96244\n-75.16121\n3,320\n\n\n3,012\n39.94218\n-75.17747\n3,264\n\n\n3,007\n39.94517\n-75.15993\n3,242\n\n\n3,061\n39.95425\n-75.17761\n3,193\n\n\n3,101\n39.94295\n-75.15955\n3,170\n\n\n3,296\n39.95134\n-75.16758\n3,088\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create sf object for stations\nstations_sf &lt;- indego %&gt;%\n  distinct(start_station, start_lat, start_lon) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(start_lat), !is.na(start_lon)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"start_lon\", \"start_lat\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Spatial join to get census tract for each station\nstations_census &lt;- st_join(stations_sf, philly_census, left = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry()\n\n# Add census variables back to the trip data\nindego_census &lt;- indego %&gt;%\n  left_join(\n    stations_census %&gt;% \n      select(start_station, Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, \n             Percent_White, Total_Pop),\n    by = \"start_station\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Identify which stations to keep\nvalid_stations &lt;- stations_census %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Med_Inc)) %&gt;%\n  pull(start_station)\n\n# Filter trip data to valid stations only\nindego_census &lt;- indego %&gt;%\n  filter(start_station %in% valid_stations) %&gt;%\n  left_join(\n    stations_census %&gt;% \n      select(start_station, Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, \n             Percent_White, Total_Pop),\n    by = \"start_station\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Get weather from Philadelphia International Airport (KPHL)\nweather_data &lt;- riem_measures(\n  station = \"PHL\",  # Philadelphia International Airport\n  date_start = \"2025-04-01\",\n  date_end = \"2025-07-31\"\n)\n\n# Process weather data\nweather_processed &lt;- weather_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    interval60 = floor_date(valid, unit = \"hour\"),\n    Temperature = tmpf,  # Temperature in Fahrenheit\n    Precipitation = ifelse(is.na(p01i), 0, p01i),  # Hourly precip in inches\n    Wind_Speed = sknt  # Wind speed in knots\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(interval60, Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n# Check for missing hours and interpolate if needed\nweather_complete &lt;- weather_processed %&gt;%\n  complete(interval60 = seq(min(interval60), max(interval60), by = \"hour\")) %&gt;%\n  fill(Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed, .direction = \"down\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Count trips by station-hour\ntrips_panel &lt;- indego_census %&gt;%\n  group_by(interval60, start_station, start_lat, start_lon,\n           Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, Percent_White, Total_Pop) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Trip_Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# How many station-hour observations?\nnrow(trips_panel)\n\n# How many unique stations?\nlength(unique(trips_panel$start_station))\n\n# How many unique hours?\nlength(unique(trips_panel$interval60))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate expected panel size\nn_stations &lt;- length(unique(trips_panel$start_station))\nn_hours &lt;- length(unique(trips_panel$interval60))\nexpected_rows &lt;- n_stations * n_hours\n\ncat(\"Expected panel rows:\", format(expected_rows, big.mark = \",\"), \"\\n\")\n\n\nExpected panel rows: 548,604 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Current rows:\", format(nrow(trips_panel), big.mark = \",\"), \"\\n\")\n\n\nCurrent rows: 179,107 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Missing rows:\", format(expected_rows -

This means that if a station was busy in the recent past, it is very likely to be busy now as well. Compared to Model 1, the effect of temperature becomes smaller because part of the temporal pattern is now captured by lagged demand. Precipitation becomes more negative and statistically significant, indicating that rainy hours reduce trips even after controlling for recent usage.

Among the census features, higher median income around a station is associated with slightly higher usage, while neighborhoods with higher transit dependence tend to show lower Indego demand. The percentage of White residents is positively associated with trip counts.

All other models also show larger MAE in Q2 (e.g., Model 1 increases from 0.60 to 0.80 trips).\n\nThis suggests that ridership in spring–early summer is somewhat harder to predict than in winter. In Q1, demand is dominated by regular commuter patterns and strong weather effects (cold temperatures and snow suppress many trips), which makes behavior more stable. In Q2, warmer weather allows for more casual and recreational trips, as well as events and irregular travel, so there is more noise that the model cannot fully capture.\nTemporal patterns also differ between Q1 and Q2.\n\nIn Q1, ridership is strongly concentrated in weekday morning and evening peaks, consistent with commuter trips, and weekends are relatively quiet. In Q2, there is more activity during the middle of the day and on weekends, reflecting recreational and leisure use in warmer months. This makes demand less purely “rush-hour driven” and more spread out, which again increases prediction error.\nIn Q2, the most important predictors are still the temporal lag features.\n\nThe coefficients on lag1Hour, lag3Hours, and lag1day are large and highly significant, indicating that recent station-level demand is the strongest signal of current ridership. Time-of-day (hour dummies), day-of-week, and temperature also matter, but their marginal effects become smaller once lags are included. Census variables and station fixed effects add some spatial structure, but they do not reduce MAE and in some cases slightly worsen out-of-sample performance, likely because they are associated with missing data and additional model complexity."

Center City also has the strongest AM/PM peak dynamics, making it more challenging for a linear model to predict accurately.\nLow-demand residential neighborhoods show much lower error (&lt;0.5 MAE) because ridership is stable and predictable."

The AM rush shows a similar pattern, though slightly milder, reflecting the model’s difficulty capturing sudden early-morning surges.\nMid-day errors are moderately high as well, particularly on weekends, when riding behavior is less routine and more sensitive to social activities or weather changes, making demand harder to predict. In contrast, overnight hours have the lowest errors because ridership is both low and stable, leaving little room for large deviations. Taken together, these patterns show that the model tends to underestimate sudden increases and slightly overestimate during gradual declines, a structural bias that appears repeatedly across hours and between weekdays and weekends."

These areas often have more discretionary travel, irregular trip purposes, and stronger weekend or leisure-based demand spikes that a basic temporal-lag model cannot fully capture. As a result, ridership becomes harder to forecast with simple hourly and daily patterns.\nIn contrast, the negative association with transit-use share implies that stations in neighborhoods with a high reliance on public transportation are more predictable. These communities typically have more consistent commuting routines and a tighter dependence on fixed schedules, which aligns very well with the temporal-lag structure of Model 2. When people ride transit regularly, they also tend to use bike share in more stable, repeated daily patterns, making these locations easier for the model to learn.\nFinally, the mild positive relationship between errors and percent White shows the pattern observed with income: neighborhoods that are more affluent, higher percentage of white or less transit-dependent tend to have more variable, less routine mobility behavior. These stations likely experience more irregular trip timing, spontaneous travel, and stronger seasonal fluctuations, features not fully captured by the current model.Relate errors to census characteristics"

Model 2 achieves an MAE of 0.6106, while Model 6 yields 0.6135, a negligible increase of approximately 0.003 trips. Although the engineered variables add meaningful behavioral interpretation, they do not improve out-of-sample predictive accuracy.\nThis result reflects the nature of Q2 bike-share demand: spring and early-summer ridership is already strongly explained by temporal autocorrelation (lag features) and hourly/weekly seasonality, with relatively consistent warm weather and limited extremes. Because these patterns dominate usage, additional features offer little incremental predictive power and instead introduce slight overfitting."

However, when evaluated out-of-sample on the Q2 test set, its MAE is 0.639, which is noticeably worse than the MAE of the linear Model 6 (0.613)."

    "text": "4.1 Operational implications\nWith a final test-set MAE of roughly 0.61 trips per station-hour, the model is accurate enough to provide meaningful operational support for Indego, especially for routine rebalancing during normal weekdays. Most stations average between 0–2 trips per hour in Q2, so an average error of 0.6 represents a relatively small deviation from true demand. In other words, the model reliably captures broad temporal patterns: commuting peaks, weather-driven changes, and weekend shifts, which are the operational factors that matter most for daily fleet management. However, from the error analysis, the system performs less consistently in areas with highly irregular or discretionary travel (Center City, university areas, tourist clusters). These are precisely the locations where under-prediction or over-prediction can create rebalancing problems: late-morning surges, sudden evening spikes, or unusually warm weekends can leave docks empty or bikes stranded unless staff intervene manually.\nGiven this, the model can be deployed operationally, but with clear conditions. It should be used as a decision-support tool, not an autonomous system. The predictions can guide baseline redistribution plans, flag high-risk hours, and help prioritize which stations need closer monitoring. But stations with historically volatile demand and days with atypical weather, holidays, or major events will still require human oversight or real-time adjustments."

    "text": "4.2 Equity considerations\nThe error patterns suggest that prediction accuracy is not evenly distributed across Philadelphia. Stations located in higher-income, majority-White neighborhoods particularly those with more discretionary and irregular travel. This show larger residuals, while stations in transit-dependent, lower-income communities tend to be more predictable. This raises an important equity concern: the model performs best in neighborhoods where travel patterns are already stable and predictable, and worst in areas where riders may rely on Indego as a flexible or secondary mobility option.\nIf such a system were deployed without safeguards, it could unintentionally reinforce existing disparities. Under-predicting demand in transit-reliant communities could mean empty docks, reduced availability, and longer wait times directly undermining mobility for riders with fewer alternatives.\nTo mitigate these risks, several safeguards should be implemented:\n\n\nEquity-weighted rebalancing rules ensuring underserved neighborhoods receive a minimum guaranteed baseline of bike availability regardless of predicted demand\n\nError monitoring that track model performance separately by neighborhood demographics\n\nHuman-in-the-loop overrides where planners can adjust allocations in census tracts showing sustained high error\n\nPeriodic model retraining with explicit fairness constraints or stratified sampling to ensure equitable performance across different community types"

    "section": "4.3 Model limitations",
    "text": "4.3 Model limitations\nDespite incorporating temporal lags, weather, spatial context, and holiday effects, the model still misses several important behavioral patterns. Bicycle demand is heavily influenced by micro-events such as neighborhood festivals, block parties, school schedules, university calendars, and special events at venues like the stadium district—none of which are captured in the current dataset. The model also assumes that relationships between predictors and demand are smooth and stable over time, but real bike-share patterns often shift abruptly due to construction, temporary station closures, seasonal promotions, or sudden weather changes that are not recorded by hourly temperature and precipitation alone. Moreover, riders make spontaneous decisions in response to perceived safety, traffic conditions, and trip chaining with transit—complex behaviors that cannot be explained using simple linear terms.\nIf given more time and richer data, the predictive system could be significantly improved by incorporating features that better capture the behavioral, spatial, and contextual complexity of bike-share demand. The current model relies primarily on temporal lags, weather, and basic spatial structure, which limits its ability to account for major demand drivers such as large events, university schedules, tourism flow, or transit disruptions. With access to real event data (concerts, stadium schedules, conventions, sports games), SEPTA operational data, academic calendars for Penn/Drexel/Temple, and park/office/restaurant POI densities, the model would be able to reflect more realistic fluctuations in ridership patterns. These variables are known to heavily shape Philadelphia’s mobility rhythms but are not represented in the present dataset.\nMethodologically, the model could be strengthened by moving beyond linear regression into more flexible forms to capture non-linear relationships and temporal dependencies that the current model cannot express. Expanding the training window to multiple years rather than a single quarter would also allow the model to learn seasonal differences, long-term trends, and year-over-year behavioral changes. With richer data and more advanced modeling frameworks, Indego could move from hour-ahead prediction toward more robust real-time forecasting and dynamic rebalancing systems."
