title: "Week 9 Notes – Critical Perspectives on Predictive Policing"
date: "2025-11-03"

## Key Concepts Learned
- Predictive policing promises efficiency, objectivity, and proactive crime prevention. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
- But these claims often rest on flawed data and assumptions. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
- **“Dirty data”** includes fabricated, biased, incomplete, or misleading data. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
- Over-policing certain communities creates feedback loops where data reflects policing patterns more than underlying crime. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}
- Multiple generations of predictive policing technology (hotspots, risk terrain, ML) all risk amplifying bias if data are flawed. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}
- Technical solutions **cannot fix fundamental social problems** or biases embedded in data. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

## Coding Techniques
✦ Week 9 focuses on **critical analysis** rather than specific coding techniques.  
✦ Examples explore how different modeling approaches can build on biased data and misinterpret patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

## Questions & Challenges
- How to detect and measure “dirty data” before modeling? :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}
- Can models be designed to **avoid reinforcing bias**, or is this a fundamentally social problem? :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}
- How to balance predictive accuracy with fairness and justice? :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}

## Connections to Policy
- Predictive policing can justify **resource deployment**, but it can also reinforce systemic inequities. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}
- Dirty data can unfairly target marginalized communities. :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}
- Decision-makers must understand **data provenance** and ethical risks before adopting analytic tools. :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}

## Reflection
- This week reminded me that **good analytics is not just good math** — it requires critical thinking about data sources. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}
- Models built on biased data can do **harm even with high technical accuracy**. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}
- I will be more careful to ask: where did the data come from, and what biases might it carry? :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}
