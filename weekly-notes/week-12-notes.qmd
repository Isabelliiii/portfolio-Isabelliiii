## Key Concepts Learned
- **Dynamics vs. snapshots**: single-year classifications miss long-term neighborhood change.
- **Neighborhood sequences**: each neighborhood is represented as a sequence of states across multiple years.
- **K-means clustering** is used to classify neighborhoods into states for each year.
- **Sequence similarity metrics** (e.g., OMstrans) allow comparison of entire trajectories, not just endpoints.
- **Hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method)** groups similar trajectories together.
- Mapping trajectory clusters reveals **spatial patterns** of stability, decline, or transformation.

## Coding Techniques
- **Z-score normalization** to make multi-year variables comparable.
- Using `kmeans()` to classify neighborhoods each year.
- Reshaping data to wide format and creating sequences with `TraMineR::seqdef()`.
- Computing sequence distances with **OMstrans**, which accounts for transitions.
- Using hierarchical clustering (`hclust(method = "ward.D2")`) to identify trajectory groups.
- Plotting trajectory clusters on maps to visualize spatial patterns.

## Questions & Challenges
- Choosing the **right number of clusters (K)**: statistical fit vs. interpretability.
- Understanding how OMstrans parameters influence the distance matrix.
- Translating trajectory groups into **actionable policy recommendations** rather than descriptive categories.

## Connections to Policy
- Different trajectory patterns imply **different policy needs** (e.g., stable neighborhoods vs. rapidly transitioning ones).
- Sequence analysis highlights **historical processes**, enabling more forward-looking planning.
- Clusters can help identify **priority areas** for intervention or monitoring.
- Understanding long-term pathways supports more equitable and place-specific policy design.

## Reflection
- Most interesting insight: neighborhoods change through **paths**, not isolated snapshots.
- Sequence analysis provides a richer understanding of urban dynamics by revealing patterns of stability, volatility, or sustained growth.
- I can apply this framework to future projects by:
  - Comparing long-term neighborhood change,
  - Identifying stagnation vs. transformation,
  - And grounding policy recommendations in multi-year trends rather than single-year metrics.
